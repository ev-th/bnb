# Merge Masters BNB

## Introduction
Merge Masters BnB is an AirBnB clone made as the first group engineering project for [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy). The app allows a user to create an account and add listings that can be rented out over a range of dates. Users can also browse other users' listings and request to book them. Users can check requests made on their listings and choose whether to accept them.

## Process and Tech
We followed Agile best practices to complete this project over the span of a week. Merge Masters BnB is a full stack web app built with Ruby, Sinatra, and PostgreSQL. We used test driven development with RSpec. 

## Demonstration

### The user lands on the log in or sign up page.
